  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    On a Scrum project, the team tracks its progress against a release plan by updating a release burndown chart at the end&#xD;
    of each sprint. The horizontal axis of the release burndown chart shows the sprints; the vertical axis shows the amount&#xD;
    of work remaining at the start of each sprint. Work remaining can be shown in whatever unit the team prefers--story&#xD;
    points, ideal days, team days, and so on.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    On this burndown chart, the team started a project that was planned to be eleven two-week sprints. They began with 200&#xD;
    story points of work. The first sprint went well and from the chart you can infer that they had around 180 story points&#xD;
    of work remaining after the first sprint. During the second sprint, however, the estimated work remaining actually&#xD;
    burned up. This could have been because work was added to the project or because the team changed some estimates of the&#xD;
    remaining work. From there the project continued well. Progress slowed during sprint 7 but then quickly resumed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This type of release burndown chart works very well in many situations and in many teams. However, on projects with&#xD;
    lots of changing requirements you may want to look at an &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
