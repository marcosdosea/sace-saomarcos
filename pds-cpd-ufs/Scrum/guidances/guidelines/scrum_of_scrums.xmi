  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The primary way of scaling Scrum to work with large teams is to coordinate a &quot;Scrum of Scrums.&quot; With this approach each&#xD;
    Scrum team proceeds as normal but each team also contributes one person who attends Scrum of Scrum meetings to&#xD;
    coordinate the work of multiple Scrum teams. These meetings are analogous to the Daily Scrum Meeting, but do not&#xD;
    necessarily happen every day. In many organizations, having a Scrum of Scrums meeting two or three times a week is&#xD;
    sufficient.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The illustration below shows how a Scrum of Scrums approach allows Scrum to scale up (in this case to 243 people). Each&#xD;
    cell represents one person on a Scrum team. The bottom of this illustration shows teams with nine developers on them.&#xD;
    One person from each team (the differently colored cell) also participates in a Scrum of Scrum to coordinate work above&#xD;
    that team. Then from those nine-person teams another person is selected (this time shown with diagonal lines) to&#xD;
    participate in what might be called a Scrum of Scrums of Scrums.&#xD;
